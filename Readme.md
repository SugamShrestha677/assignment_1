# HTML Basics Assignment

## 📌 Assignment Title
HTML Forms, Tables, and Semantic Elements

## 📖 Description
This project demonstrates fundamental HTML concepts through three exercises:
1. **Form Creation** – A simple form with text input, radio buttons, checkboxes, textarea, and a submit button.
2. **Table Creation** – A table with headers, multiple rows, merged cells, borders, and a caption.
3. **Semantic HTML Page** – A webpage structured with semantic elements (`header`, `nav`, `article`, `aside`, `footer`).

The goal is to practice writing clean, organized, and functional HTML code.

## 🚀 Steps to Run the Project
1. Copy the provided HTML code into a file named `index.html`.
2. Save the file on your computer.
3. Open the file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
4. Explore:
   - The **form** section to input data.
   - The **table** section to view organized information.
   - The **semantic webpage** section to understand structured layout.
